#Oh, the places you'll go!

###By Dr. Suess

You have brains in your head.<br>
You have feet in your shoes<br>
You can steer yourself<br>
Any direction you choose.<br>
You’re on your own. And <br>
you know what you know.<br >ghg
And YOU are the guy who’ll<br>
decide where to go.<br>

You’ll get mixed up,
of course, as you already know.<br>
You’ll get mixed up with<br>
many strange birds as you go.<br>
So be sure when you step.<br>
Step with care and great<br>
tact and remember that<br>
Life’s A Great Balancing Act.<br>

And will you succeed?<br>
**Yes!** You will, indeed!<br>
(98 and ¾ percent guaranteed.)<br>

**KID, YOU’LL MOVE <br>
MOUNTAINS!**:sunrise_over_mountains:
